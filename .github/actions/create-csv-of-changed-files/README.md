# 🚀 Create CSV of Changed Files GitHub Action

Creates CSV files listing IDs to be deleted and uploaded based on Git diff.

---

## ✨ Overview

This action processes Git diff output to identify which Integration Packages or Partner Directory entries have changed between two Git references. It generates two CSV files: one for deletions (items in base but not in target) and one for uploads (items that changed and need to be uploaded).

## 📂 Outputs

| Name       | Description                                  |

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

- The action extracts unique second-level directory names from the diff file.
- Delete CSV contains IDs present in base but missing in target (deletions).
- Upload CSV contains IDs that changed, excluding those marked for deletion.
- The mode parameter determines whether to process IntegrationPackages or PartnerDirectory.
- IDs are extracted from directory names (the part after the `~` separator).
- Empty CSV files are handled gracefully.
- The action uses `set +e` to continue processing even if individual files are missing or empty.
- Both output CSV files are created in `${{ runner.temp }}`, which is cleaned up after the workflow completes.
